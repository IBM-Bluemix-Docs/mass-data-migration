## What is {{site.data.keyword.mdms_full_notm}}?
{: faq}

{{site.data.keyword.mdms_full_notm}} is a physical data transfer service that accelerates the secure movement of terabytes to petabytes of data into the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} by using rugged, 120 TB-usable capacity, portable storage devices.

## How is {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} initiated?
{: faq}

Use the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://{DomainName}/catalog/){:new_window} to submit your request. When your request is approved and processed, the next available device or devices are configured and sent to you based on your network and shipping information. Use the following link to start now: https://control.softlayer.com/storage/mdms

## Why use {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}}?
{: faq}

{{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} devices are equipped to perform in nearly any environment from data centers and offices to remote locations, warehouses, and ships. {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} is also an alternative if over-the-network data transfer options are cost-prohibitive, too slow, or unavailable.


## How much data can be transferred by using {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}}?
{: faq}

There's virtually no limit to the amount of data you can transfer, whether itâ€™s a few terabytes to petabytes. Each device holds up to 120 TB of usable capacity at RAID-6, but you can use multiple devices to accommodate larger workloads. The largest single object is limited to 10 TB.


## Can multiple devices be used to move larger workloads that exceed 120 TB? If yes, how?
{: faq}

Use multiple devices in parallel or in a series to move all data in a single migration or use a single device in iterative migrations. For example, transfer 1 PB of data by using nine devices in parallel, or use a single device in nine separate migrations.


## How long does it take to transfer the data?
{: faq}

From the time, a customer submits a {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} Request to when their data is accessible in their {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}} bucket, the turnaround time can be as little as seven days. The transfer performance is affected by the number of files to be transferred. Transferring of millions of small files take longer than the same amount of data contained in relatively few files.

## How long can the {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} device be kept?

A device can be kept onsite at no cost for the first 10 business days. This time frame doesn't include the day that your device is shipped or the day you receive it. If more time is needed to complete your ingestion, you can extend your use for USD 30 per day thereafter (applies to US and EU regions).
