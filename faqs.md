Frequently asked questions about {{site.data.keyword.mdms_full}}.
{: shortdesc}

## What is {{site.data.keyword.mdms_full_notm}}?
{: #what-is-mdms}
{: faq}

{{site.data.keyword.mdms_full_notm}} is a physical data transfer service that accelerates the secure movement of terabytes to petabytes of data into the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} by using rugged, 120 TB-usable capacity, portable storage devices.

## How do I start using {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}}?
{: #how-to-use-mdms}
{: faq}

Use the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog](https://{DomainName}/mdms) to submit your request. After you submit your request, a member of the Mass Data Migration team will contact you or your IBM Client Representative to confirm the order. When your request is confirmed and processed, the next available device or devices are configured and sent to you based on your network and shipping information.

## Who should use {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}}?
{: #who-uses-mdms}
{: faq}

From data centers and offices to remote locations like oil rigs and ships, {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} devices are equipped to perform in nearly any environment. {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} is also a great alternative if over-the-network data transfer options are too cost-prohibitive, slow, or unavailable.

## How much data can I transfer by using {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}}?
{: #how-much-data}
{: faq}

There is virtually no limit to the amount of data you can transfer, whether itâ€™s a few terabytes or many petabytes. Each device holds up to 120 TB of usable capacity at RAID-6, but you can use multiple devices to accommodate larger workloads. {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} also offers inline compression, which may further increase usable capacity depending on how compressible your data set is. The largest single object is limited to 10 TB in size.


## How do I use multiple devices to move larger workloads that exceed 120 TB?
{: #using-multiple-devices}
{: faq}

Use multiple devices in parallel or in a series to move all data in a single migration or use a single device in iterative migrations. For example, transfer 1 PB of data by using nine devices in parallel, or use a single device in nine separate migrations. If you use multiple devices in parallel, keep in mind that the ingestion rate will be slower.

## How long does it take to transfer my data?
{: #transfer-timeline}
{: faq}

From the time a customer submits a {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} request to when their data is accessible in their IBM Cloud Object Storage bucket, the turnaround time can be a matter of days. Transfer performance can be affected by many factors like networking, bandwidth, or the number of files being transferred. For example, transferring millions of small files will take longer than the same amount of data contained in relatively fewer, larger files.

## How long can I have a {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} device?
{: #device-onsite-time}
{: support}
{: faq}

You can keep a device onsite for up to 90 days before a member of the {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} team will reach out to you or your IBM Client Representative. At that time, you may be asked to provide an estimated completion timeframe and/or return the device to IBM. Applies to all regions. 

## Is IBM Cloud Object Storage the only supported offload destination?
{: #supported-cloud-destination}
{: support}
{: faq}

Cloud Object Storage is currently the only supported offload destination at this time. If you need to move to move your data to a different storage solution, see [Migration guide: Moving data from Cloud Object Storage to File or Block Storage](/docs/mass-data-migration?topic=mass-data-migration-move-data-from-cos).

## How does the {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} process keep the uniqueness of object names?
{: #object-name-uniqueness}
{: faq}

To ensure that object names are unique when they are copied into a Cloud Object Storage bucket, the file path is included a prefix in the object name. For example, `/root/user/config.ini` becomes `root/user/config.ini` when it is copied into the bucket.

## Are links skipped during the scan process?
{: #links-scan-process}
{: faq}

Yes. Symlinks and hard links are skipped during the scan process.

## Can I connect macOS servers to {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} devices using SMB?
{: #connect-macOS-smb}
{: support}
{: faq}

It is possible to connect {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} devices to macOS servers using SMB. However, keep in mind that optimal throughput isn't attainable without significant tuning to the macOS client.

The list of tuning considerations includes and is not limited to: 

- [Disabling SMB signing on the client](/docs/mass-data-migration?topic=mass-data-migration-troubleshooting#unable-to-mount-smb-share)
- Determining a network sizing strategy
- Using TCP delayed acknowledgement (ACK)
- Enabling SMB configuration options that are specific to your implementation, data set, and network capacity

## Can I mount a NFS share with `no_root_squash` enabled?
{: #no-root-squash-option}
{: faq}

For security reasons, the `no_root_squash` option is disabled for NFS server configuration. The root user on any client host automatically gets a user identifer (UID) or group identifer (GID) that is equal to the `nfsnobody` user written to the file system. Files cannot be created on the NFS server as being owned by root.

All files written to an NFS share by a root user on a client host will have their files written to the NFS server as user `nfsnobody`.
