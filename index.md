After submitting the request, the status for the request ticket will appear as *Processing Request*. Your order is then reviewed. If you wish to cancel your Request you may do so while the request is being processed by sending an email to mdmadmin@bg.vnet.ibm.com. 

Once the order is accepted and the device is being prepared the status of the [Active Request](https://control.softlayer.com/storage/mdms){:new_window} shows *Prepping Device* followed by *Awaiting Shipment*. Once your Request enters *Awaiting Shipment* status, it can no longer be canceled. 

When the device is sent to your location the request status is updated to *Device Shipped*. The tracking number will be shared with you in the [Active Request](https://control.softlayer.com/storage/mdms){:new_window}.

### Onboarding of Data from Your Data Center

1. The device arrives pre-configured for your data load. Basic [powering/connectivity instruction](user-instructions.html) will be included. <br/>
  **Note**: User name and storage pool password will be provided separately. Please check the Request Details of your [Active Request](https://control.softlayer.com/storage/mdms){:new_window} for the credentials.
2. Point browser to the static IP address you provided in the order form.
3. Log in, supply password to unlock the empty storage pool. <br/>
   **Note**: See the Request Details of your [Active Request](https://control.softlayer.com/storage/mdms){:new_window} for the password.
4. Mount the NFS share on your server.
5. Re-run your DataShuttle inventory to ensure any new files that may have been created since the application are captured.
6. Run the DataShuttle copy to move the data.
7. Lock the storage pool.
8. Gracefully shut down the MDMS device.
9. Ship box back to {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} Data Center using provided shipping label.
10. Notify mdmsadmin@us.ibm.com the transfer is complete and device is in-flight.

When the device is returned to {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer}} the request status changes to *Device Received*. During the transfer process the request status displays as *Offloading Data*. The status changes again when the migration to the {{site.data.keyword.objectstorageshort}} Bucket is complete (*Offload Complete*), and data is removed from the device (*Erase Complete*).

## Additional Notes

### Uniqueness in the Bucket

To ensure object names are unique when they are copied into the bucket, the file path is included a prefix in the object name;  `/root/user/config.ini` becomes "root/user/config.ini" when copied into the bucket.

### Buckets

If the target bucket does not exist, it is created.   If it does exist, it must be empty, otherwise the copy cannot proceed.  

### File Systems

Symlinks and Hardlinks are skipped during the scan process.
