When the device is returned to {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer}} the ticket status changes *Device Returned*. During the transfer process the request status displays as *Migration Started*. The status changes again when the migration to the COS Bucket is complete (*Migration Complete*) and data is removed from the device (*Data Removed*).

## Additional Notes

### Uniqueness in the Bucket

To ensure object names are unique when they are copied into the bucket, the file path is included a prefix in the object name;  `/root/user/config.ini` becomes "root/user/config.ini" when copied into the bucket.

### Buckets

If the target bucket does not exist, it is created.   If it does exist, it must be empty, otherwise the copy cannot proceed.  

### File Systems

Symlinks and Hardlinks are skipped during the scan process.
