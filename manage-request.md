<!--After you submit the request, you receive an e-mail to confirm your order. Orders that are submitted during normal business hours are approved `the following business day`, and then shipped overnight to the specified location.-->

<!--When {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} receives your {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} device, the order status in the {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} dashboard is updated to **Data offload**. The device is connected to the network in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data center, and the data copy starts automatically. 

Depending on the data size, the copy process can take from a few hours to days to complete. You can monitor the migration progress by navigating to the _Request details_ tab in the {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} dashboard. 

After the data copy is completed, the order status changes to **Erase data**.-->
