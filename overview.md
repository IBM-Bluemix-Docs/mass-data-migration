# {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Mass Data Migration Overview

A fast, simple, secure way to physically transfer terabytes to petabytes of data to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}.

## What is Mass Data Migration?

Mass Data Migration uses 120 TB-usable capacity storage devices to accelerate moving data to the cloud and overcome common transfer challenges like high costs, long transfer times and security concerns â€“ all in a single service.

## Mass Data Migration Benefits
1. Move data fast
    - Using a single Mass Data Migration device, you can migrate up to 120TB of data (at RAID-6) in just days, as opposed to weeks or months using traditional data transfer methods.
2. Flexible and scalable
    - Whether you need to migrate a few terabytes or many petabytes of data, you have the flexibility to request one or multiple devices to accommodate your workload.
3. Affordable
    - Moving large data sets can be expensive and time-consuming. Each Mass Data Migration device is offered at an affordable rate including roundtrip shipping and 10 days of use at your site. 
4. Simple process
    - {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} sends you a pre-configured device for you to simply connect, ingest data and then ship back to {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} for offload into {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}}. Once offloaded, enjoy immediate access to your data in the cloud while we securely wipe the device.
5. End-to-end protection
    - Device design maximizes security from the inside-out using AES 256-bit encryption, RAID-6 configuration and rugged, tamper-evident, waterproof, shockproof cases to promote data protection and integrity during device-handling and transport.
6. Secure erasure
    - {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} uses a four-pass DOD-Level data wipe to ensure complete erasure of all customer data from Mass Data Migration devices.

## Mass Data Migration Use Cases
1. Migrating data to the cloud
    - Whether you want to free-up on-premises storage space, archive inactive data, or back-up data for redundancy and recovery, Mass Data Migration can quickly and securely move your data to the cloud.

2. Data center decommission
    - Jumpstart your data center transformation and use Mass Data Migration to securely move your sensitive data to the cloud as you downsize, expand or relocate your data center.

3. Limited bandwidth
    - Mass Data Migration is a great alternative if you are in a remote location or find over-the-network options to be cost-prohibitive, too slow, or unavailable for your data transfer.
