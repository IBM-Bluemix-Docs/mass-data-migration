## Available storage locations
{: #available-regions}

{{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} is available in the United States and the European Union. Your data is migrated into Cloud Object Storage, where you can choose from different storage classes, locations, and resiliency for your stored data. 

{{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} devices are confined to the region where they are sent to. Devices can't be sent from one region and returned to another region.
