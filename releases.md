# What's new
{: #releases}

Stay up to date with the new features that are available for {{site.data.keyword.mdms_full}}.
{: shortdesc}

## November 2020
{: #nov-2020}

We revamped the {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} pricing model.


### Price Model Update
{: #price-model-update}
New as of: 2020-11-16

{{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} has implemented a new, simplified, streamlined price model applicable to 
all customers in all regions. Going forward, {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} is priced at 50 USD per day; 
50 USD daily charges begin the day the {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} device arrives at your location, 
and stop the day the device returns to IBM for offload into IBM Cloud. Roundtrip shipping is included in 
the price. There are no other charges affiliated with {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} â€“ please note that 
you will accrue associated Cloud Object Storage (COS) costs as soon as the {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} 
team offloads your data to your specified COS bucket, as always.

## December 2019
{: #dec-2019}

We revamped the {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} ordering experience so you can start your data transfer journey from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

### Requesting a {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} device
{: #changed-order-form}
New as of: 2019-12-18

You can now request {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} devices from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog using a simplified order form.

You can get to the simplified order form by selecting the [Storage category in the catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?category=storage#services){: external}, and then selecting the {{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} tile.  

This experience replaces the previous order flow that is available in the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}.
